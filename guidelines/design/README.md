# Espejo Design System Guidelines

Welcome to the Espejo Design System guidelines. This comprehensive design system documentation provides a structured approach to implementing the Espejo visual identity across all interfaces, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and a professional user experience.

## Design System Overview

The Espejo design system is built around a warm, supportive, and empowering identity for job seekers. It combines a sophisticated Graphite & Terracotta color scheme, clear typography hierarchy, and minimalist interface elements to create a focused and calming user experience.

### Core Design Principles

- **Clarity and Focus:** Clean, minimalist interfaces that guide users without cognitive overload
- **Consistency:** Reusable components, predictable spacing, and a unified visual language
- **Modern & Approachable:** Professional aesthetics balanced with warmth and personality
- **Accessibility:** Sufficient color contrast, clear focus states, and inclusive design patterns
- **Theming:** Robust light/dark mode implementation for personalized user experiences

### Guidelines Organization

This design system is organized into the following sections:


- [Color System](./color-system.md)
- [Typography](./typography.md)
- [Spacing & Layout](./spacing-and-layout.md)
- [Focus Management](./focus-management.md)


## Implementation Guidelines

The Espejo design system is implemented using:

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- CSS custom properties for theming and design tokens
- Feature-first organization for component structure
- Type-safe implementations with TypeScript

### Implementation Status

This design system has been implemented in the Experience Miner application, with the Guide Screen (`/guide/*` routes) serving as the reference implementation.

## Contributing to the Design System

When extending or modifying the design system:

1. Review existing patterns before creating new ones
2. Ensure accessibility in all design decisions
3. Test across both light and dark themes
4. Validate responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. Update documentation to reflect changes

## Getting Started

Start by exploring the Visual System documentation to understand the fundamental design elements, then proceed to the Components and Layout sections for specific implementation patterns.
